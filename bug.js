This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and attempting to render a large number of items. The performance issue is caused by the default behavior of FlatList, which renders all items at once, leading to significant lag and potential crashes.  The code might look something like this:
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={largeArray}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
/>
```
